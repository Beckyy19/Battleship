	======================= RULES OF THE BATTLESHIP GAME OF ALINE & REBECCA ================================================

	Each player's fleet contains 5 differents ships : 
	-----------------
	Carrier (5 holes)
	Battleship (4 holes)
	Cruiser (3 holes)
	Submarine (3 holes)
	Destroyer (2 holes)
	------------------

	=> SETUP

	You and your opponent sit facing each other and neighter can see the other's ocean grid.
	Place your fleet of 5 ships on the ocean grid (board size 10x10).

	=> RULES FOR PLACING SHIPS
	
	Place each ship in any horizontal or vertical position but not diagonally.
	Don't place a ship so that any part of it overlaps letters, numbers, the edge of the grid or another ship.
	Don't change the position of any ships once the game has begun.

	=> GAME PLAY

	You and your opponent will alternate turns, calling out one shot per turn to try to hit each other's ships.
	On your turn, pick a target hole and call out its location by letter & number.
	When you call a shot, your opponent must tell you whether your shot is a hit or a miss.

		It's a hit : If you call out a shot location that is occupied by a ship on your opponent's ocean grid, you shot is a hit!
			     Your opponent tells you which ship you have hit (cruiser, submarine, battleship, etc...).
			     Record yur hit by placing a red peg on your target grid. Your opponent places a red peg in the corresponding hole of the ship
			     on his ocean grid.

		It's a miss : If you call out a shot location not occupied by a ship on your opponent's ocean grid, its a miss.
			      Record you miss by placing a white peg in the corresponding target hole on your target grid, so you will remember this location
			      and won't call this shot again.

	=> SINKING A SHIP

	Once all the holes in any one ship are filled with red pegs, the ship will sink. The owner of that ship must announce which ship was sunk.



	=> END OF THE GAME

	If you are the first player to sink your opponent's entire fleet of 5 ships, you win the game.
